::: warning Manual install
If you follow all the Ae instructions and AEUX still isn't showing up in the AE Window>Extensions menu, do a manual install. You didn't do anything wrong, it just happens sometimes wth extensions.
- Change the extension of the AEUX.zxp file to .zip. It might give you a dialog warning about changing the file type but ignore it.
- Unzip this file to get a folder called AEUX
- Navigate to the Adobe extensions folder:
  - **Mac**: /Users/**username**/Library/Application Support/Adobe/CEP/extensions/
  - **Win**: C:/Users/**username**/AppData/Roaming/Adobe/CEP/extensions/
